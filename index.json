I have been selected as a Software Engineer at Cisco, India. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to share my interview experience and I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it.\nOnline Round # In this round, I dealt with questions from the following domains:\n Aptitude Basics of Cryptography Computer Networks Data Structures \u0026amp; Algorithms DBMS Operating Systems  I took the online MCQ and coding test in the morning, and the results of the same were published on the same evening. Candidates who have cleared this round are invited to join a Webex Space, where all important announcements regarding the interview process will be made.\nThe whole interview process happened via Webex the next day, and it consisted of three rounds â€” Technical round, Managerial round and HR round.\nTechnical Round # This was an interesting round. I was asked about each of the projects that I\u0026rsquo;ve put in my resume. It is a very important section of our interview, as the answers for the questions reveal the depth of our knowledge on our projects. Having a proper and clear understanding of the concepts on the projects in our resume will help us answer such questions with confidence.\nThere were two or three occasions where I was not sure of the answer. But I expressed my thought process for those questions, as it is important for the interviewer to know how you think. I was asked questions from various domains such as DBMS, Java, Python and Web development. At the end of an hour, the round completed with some basic non-technical questions.\nManagerial Round # This round was relaxed and chill compared to the first round. I was asked questions which test our decision-making ability. I got to share some situations where things went in a way which wasn\u0026rsquo;t expected, and how I overcame them. I was also asked why I chose to be in Cisco. Lastly, I got to know the work-life balance in Cisco from my interviewers.\nHR Round # This was also a cool round where I was asked some questions about the company and its goals. Then I was asked for priority of locations to work and at last, I was conveyed the details of the role, stipend and CTC.\nThe interview process started at 8:00 am and I completed all the rounds at around 5:00 pm. Then in the evening of the same day, the results of the interview process were announced.\nMy Thoughts # The interview experience was amazing and I learned a lot. I did face a little difficulty with keeping up with the interview announcements as all shortlisted candidates were included in the same space in Webex and each of us received our invitations from that single location. Other than that, the overall experience was great. The interviewers were kind and amicable.\nThings that helped me # Invlove in challenges which allow you to acquire the skill of solving problems on a daily basis. My #100DaysOfCode challenge helped me a lot. Also, ask all possible questions to yourself whenever you are learning important concepts. Last but not the least, if things didn\u0026rsquo;t happen as expected, do not lose the spirit, keep up the positive attitude and work harder. Things will turn out in your favour.\n Believe in yourself!\n ","date":"2 July 2021","permalink":"/posts/experience/my-first-interview/","section":"Posts","summary":"In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll share the experience on my first interview with Cisco.","title":"My First Interview"}]
